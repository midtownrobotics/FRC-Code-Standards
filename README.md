# FRC 1648 Code Standards
This repository is the definitive guide for all team members, outlining the coding conventions and best practices to follow when developing software for our robotics projects. Consistency, readability, and maintainability are key to sustaining a high-quality codebase. These guidelines have been crafted to ensure that every contributor follows a unified approach, helping us build reliable, efficient, and scalable systems.

## Purpose
This repository defines the coding standards and best practices that guide our teamâ€™s software development process. The purpose is to ensure that our codebase remains clear, maintainable, and scalable while promoting collaboration and technical excellence. These guidelines serve not only as rules but as a foundation for building high-quality robotics software that every team member can confidently contribute to. By following these practices, we aim to:

* Improve Code Clarity: Write code that is easy to read, understand, and modify, making it accessible to all team members, regardless of experience.
* Support Collaboration: Create a cohesive development environment by establishing uniform coding conventions, enabling smoother teamwork and onboarding of new developers.
* Ensure Maintainability: Build a robust codebase that can be easily maintained and extended, ensuring the longevity of our projects across seasons.
* Boost Efficiency and Reliability: Reduce bugs and development time by using proven, standardized approaches for coding, testing, and debugging.
* Foster Innovation and Excellence: Encourage a culture of continual learning, improvement, and technical mastery by adhering to professional-level coding standards.
* Ensure Safety and Robustness: Implement safeguards in code to protect against failures or unforeseen issues, ensuring the safety and reliability of our robots in competition and testing.
